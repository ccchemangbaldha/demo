The subject was originally developed to solve\ngeometric problems involving triangles. It was studied by\nsea captains for navigation, surveyor to map out the new\nlands, by engineers and others. Currently, trigonometry is\nused in many areas such as the science of seismology,\ndesigning electric circuits, describing the state of an atom,\npredicting the heights of tides in the ocean, analysing a\nmusical tone and in many other areas.\nIn earlier classes, we have studied the trigonometric\nArya Bhatt\nratios of acute angles as the ratio of the sides of a right (476-550)\nangled triangle. We have also studied the trigonometric identities and application of\ntrigonometric ratios in solving the problems related to heights and distances. In this\nChapter, we will generalise the concept of trigonometric ratios to trigonometric functions\nand study their properties."

We will now extend the definition of trigonometric\nratios to any angle in terms of radian measure and study them as trigonometric functions.\nConsider a unit circle with centre\nat origin of the coordinate axes. Let\nP (a, b) be any point on the circle with\nangle AOP = x radian, i.e., length of arc\nAP = x (Fig 3.6).\nWe define cos x = a and sin x = b\nSince \u2206OMP is a right triangle, we have\nOM2 + MP2 = OP2 or a2 + b2 = 1\nThus, for every point on the unit circle,\nwe have\na2 + b2 = 1 or cos2 x + sin2 x = 1\nSince one complete revolution\nsubtends an angle of 2\u03c0 radian at the\n\u03c0\ncentre of the circle, \u2220AOB = , Fig 3.6\n2\nReprint 2025-26\n50 MATHEMATICS\n3\u03c0 \u03c0\n\u2220AOC = \u03c0 and \u2220AOD = .

Therefore, for quadrantal angles, we have\ncos 0\u00b0= 1 sin 0\u00b0 = 0,\n\u03c0 \u03c0\ncos = 0 sin = 1\n2 2\ncos\u03c0= \u2212 1 sin\u03c0 = 0\n3\u03c0 3\u03c0\ncos = 0 sin = \u20131\n2 2\ncos 2\u03c0= 1 sin 2\u03c0 = 0\nNow, if we take one complete revolution from the point P, we again come back to\nsame point P.

    "text": "In this Section, we shall derive expressions for trigonometric functions of the sum and difference of two numbers (angles) and related expressions. The basic results in this connection are called trigonometric identities. We have seen that 1. sin (\u2013 x) = \u2013 sin x 2. cos (\u2013 x) = cos x We shall now prove some more results: Reprint 2025-26 58 MATHEMATICS 3. cos (x + y) = cos x cos y \u2013 sin x sin y Consider the unit circle with centre at the origin. Letx be the angle P OP and y be 4 1 the angle P OP . Then (x + y) is the angle P OP . Also let (\u2013 y) be the angle P OP . 1 2 4 2 4 3 Therefore, P , P , P and P will have the coordinates P (cos x, sin x), 1 2 3 4 1 P [cos (x + y), sin (x + y)], P [cos (\u2013 y), sin (\u2013 y)] and P (1, 0) (Fig 3.14). 2 3 4 Fig 3.14 Consider the triangles P OP and P OP . They are congruent (Why?). Therefore, 1 3 2 4 P P and P P are equal.

Also, P P 2 = [1 \u2013 cos (x + y)] 2 + [0 \u2013 sin (x + y)]2 2 4 = 1 \u2013 2cos (x + y) + cos2 (x + y) + sin2 (x + y) = 2 \u2013 2 cos (x + y) Reprint 2025-26 TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 59 Since P P = P P , we have P P 2 = P P 2. 1 3 2 4 1 3 2 4 Therefore, 2 \u20132 (cos x cos y \u2013 sin x sin y) = 2 \u2013 2 cos (x + y). Hence cos (x + y) = cos x cos y \u2013 sin x sin y 4. cos (x \u2013 y) = cos x cos y + sin x sin y Replacing y by \u2013 y in identity 3, we get cos (x + (\u2013 y)) = cos x cos (\u2013 y) \u2013 sin x sin (\u2013 y) or cos (x \u2013 y) = cos x cos y + sin x sin y \u03c0 5. cos ( \u2013 x) = sin x 2 \u03c0 If we replace x by and y by x in Identity (4), we get 2 \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0 cos ( \u2212x) = cos cos x + sin sin x = sin x. 2 2 2 \u03c0 6. sin ( \u2013 x) = cos x 2 Using the Identity 5, we have \u03c0 \uf8ee\u03c0 \uf8eb\u03c0 \uf8f6\uf8f9 sin ( \u2212x) = cos \uf8ef \u2212\uf8ec \u2212x\uf8f7\uf8fa = cos x. 2 \uf8f02 \uf8ed2 \uf8f8\uf8fb 7. sin (x + y) = sin x cos y + cos x sin y We know that \uf8eb\u03c0 \uf8f6 \uf8eb \u03c0 \uf8f6 sin (x + y) = cos \uf8ec \u2212(x+ y)\uf8f7 = cos \uf8ec( \u2212x)\u2212 y\uf8f7 \uf8ed2 \uf8f8 \uf8ed 2 \uf8f8 \u03c0 \u03c0 = cos ( \u2212x) cos y + sin ( \u2212x)sin y 2 2 = sin x cos y + cos x sin y 8. sin (x \u2013 y) = sin x cos y \u2013 cos x sin y If we replace y by \u2013y, in the Identity 7, we get the result. 9.

The ancient Indian\nMathematicians, Aryabhatta (476), Brahmagupta (598), Bhaskara I (600) and\nBhaskara II (1114) got important results. All this knowledge first went from\nIndia to middle-east and from there to Europe. The Greeks had also started the\nstudy of trigonometry but their approach was so clumsy that when the Indian\napproach became known, it was immediately adopted throughout the world.\nIn India, the predecessor of the modern trigonometric functions, known as\nthe sine of an angle, and the introduction of the sine function represents the main\ncontribution of the siddhantas (Sanskrit astronomical works) to the history of\nmathematics.\nBhaskara I (about 600) gave formulae to find the values of sine functions\nfor angles more than 90\u00b0. A sixteenth century Malayalam work Yuktibhasa\n(period) contains a proof for the expansion of sin (A + B). Exact expression for\nsines or cosines of 18\u00b0, 36\u00b0, 54\u00b0, 72\u00b0, etc., are given by\nBhaskara II.\nReprint 2025-26\nTRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS 75\nThe symbols sin\u20131 x, cos\u20131 x, etc., for arc sin x, arc cos x, etc., were\nsuggested by the astronomer Sir John F.W. Hersehel (1813) The names of Thales\n(about 600 B.C.) is invariably associated with height and distance problems. He\nis credited with the determination of the height of a great pyramid in Egypt by\nmeasuring shadows of the pyramid and an auxiliary staff (or gnomon) of known\nheight, and comparing the ratios:\nH h\n= = tan (sun\u2019s altitude)\nS s\nThales is also said to have calculated the distance of a ship at sea through\nthe proportionality of sides of similar triangles. Problems on height and distance\nusing the similarity property are also found in ancient Indian works.\n\u2014 vvvvv \u2014\nReprint 2025-26"
